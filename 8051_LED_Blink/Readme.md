## Tool Description
* Keil uVision 5 C51 IDE is a comprehensive integrated development environment tailored for 8051 microcontroller-based projects. Developed by ARM, it offers a user-friendly platform for writing, compiling, and debugging embedded C programs. With support for various 8051 derivatives, it provides a rich set of features including code editing, project management, and simulation capabilities. The IDE seamlessly integrates the Keil C51 compiler and debugger, streamlining the development process for 8051-based applications. Its intuitive interface and powerful tools make it a preferred choice for embedded systems developers, facilitating efficient coding, testing, and debugging in a single environment.

## Aim
* Write a program to toggle an LED on port 1, pin P1.0 with a delay using an 8051 microcontroller and Keil Î¼vision 5 software.

## Conclusion
* As calculated in theory, the practical simulation results were the same, that is after a transient analysis of 1ms delay, the capacitor charges linearly until it reaches the 1V mark.
