## Tool Description
* Keil uVision 5 IDE is a comprehensive integrated development environment tailored for 8051 microcontroller-based projects. Developed by ARM, it offers a user-friendly platform for writing, compiling, and debugging embedded C programs. With support for various 8051 derivatives, it provides a rich set of features including code editing, project management, and simulation capabilities. The IDE seamlessly integrates the Keil C51 compiler and debugger, streamlining the development process for 8051-based applications. Its intuitive interface and powerful tools make it a preferred choice for embedded systems developers, facilitating efficient coding, testing, and debugging in a single environment.

## Aim
* To interface and program the 8051-microcontroller for taking inputs from a 4*4 matrix keyboard and display on a 7-segment display using Keil μvision 5 software.

## Theory
The predominant interface between humans and hardware is the keyboard. The matrix keypad allows a designer to implement a large number of inputs with a small number of port pins. For example, 16 keys arranged as a 4 x 4 matrix can be implemented with only eight port pins. These keypads were evolved originally for telephonic applications involving touch—tone signaling.

## Conclusion
I learned the interfacing of the 4*4 matrix keyboard and the 7-segment display with the 8051-microcontroller using Keil μvision 5 software. I also learned about the key debounce function which helps to avoid false key acceptance.
